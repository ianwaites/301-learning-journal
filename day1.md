## Learning Journal Day 1

First day of class is always rough for me because I know we are going to have to do introductions in front of the whole class and I am not good at public speaking... But I did my introduction and was able to feel a little less anxious this time around (it helped that the group I was speaking to was full of people from my 201, so that made it easier) which made me happy.

A big change between 301 and 201 is the schedule. During 201 we would have lecture in the morning and in 301 we have it in the afternoon. This allows us to have lab for a couple hours after lecture and in the morning prior to lecture. I really like this schedule, but it seems a lot of people are having problems with it. We'll see how it plays out!
