## Learning Journal Day 11

Today we started to learn about routing for use within Single Page Applications. This has been a tough pill for me to swallow because I feel like this is somewhat of an old trend that is being pushed aside for having single page applications that don't hide data. Rather, they display all of the data in sections allowing you to navigate to the section you choose, while having the other sections readily available if you decide to scroll up or down or click the nav. Either way, it nice to learn how to utilize route.js in case I ever need to use it!
