## Learning Journal Day 13

Today we learned how to deploy to Heroku! It is pretty awesome how it integrates with Git and works with Postgres.

I was also able to talk with Scott in our 1:1 and mentioned that I would really like to be part of Zach's project idea. Luckily Scott Ok'd Zach's idea and I was able to be part of his team. I am really excited for our project and can really see the benefits of these Code Fellows projects and the potential they have to be a big part of our resume. There is even a chance they alone can be our resume... I really want to keep that in mind during the development and create a beautiful app that serves some good.

At the same time I am really nervous knowing the entrance test is only a couple of days away and I am really starting to get testing anxiety. I really want to move onto 401 and would hate for anything to happen that would prevent me from moving on.
