## Learning Journal Day 15

So, we have started work on our final project. It sounds like it is going to be a lot of work, but I am really excited to be a part of it. We have implemented good MVP goals with fall backs incase we find out that we won't have enough time to implement our MVP's.

I am writing this learning journal prior to taking the 401 entrance exam and am freaking out about the possibility of failing it. I have to remember to take my time and really make sure I feel confident in my answers prior to submitting them. I know I felt like I moved too fast through the 301 entrance test and I don't want to have that feeling again!

I am also still so torn about which 401 I want to take, but I am pretty much set on moving forward into the JS 401. If I am able to part of 401, I will only have a 2 week break between the end of 301 and the start of 401. Other people I have talked to are planning on taking more time off to have a rest and digest the information from 201 and 301. So that is also giving me second thoughts about moving straight onto 401. But with that said, I need to finish Code Fellows ASAP and get back out into the field because not having a source of income is terrible.
