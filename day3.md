## Learning Journal Day 3

I am really loving this first week of 301 since we are focusing on the front end of web dev. I feel at home with the @media's and love learning the best practices. That being said, I have developed so many bad habits over the years making it hard for me to drop them and use the methods being taught here...

So far the labs are going ok - every lab is paired programming which can make it either more challenging or easier depending on the lab and how I my partner and I work together. I do miss having solo labs where I am able to put headphones on and crank out the work, rather than having to talk through every decision with a partner.
