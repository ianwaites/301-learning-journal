## Learning Journal Day 6

Class today was pretty fun! We started learning about AJAX and JSON. I am really excited to learn the ins and outs of API's and hope we really get to dive into their inner workings.

I have really started to feel Code Fellows introduces you to new functionality everyday, but never really dives too deep into it. They teach us enough to get up and running and then move onto something else. Often times it leaves me feeling like there is so much more to learn and I hope I am not missing out on anything.

With our current schedule it makes it somewhat hard to take a deep dive into things on my own time, so it leaves me wishing the 301 was a 10 week course as well. I am starting to feel like there is too much to cover in just 4 weeks!!!
