## Learning Journal Day 8

We are finally starting to work in SQL! I have been wanting to learn SQL for a while now because there are so many jobs that require you to know it. So far it has been a relief to work with it since the language  used in the database itself is pretty simple. The logic is clear and understandable. So far I haven't come across any language used that was minding blowing. That being said, if you are working within a large database you might have to write some long winded queries to get the data you need.

Overall, I am really happy to be working within Postgres and hope to learn a lot more about it!
